# React Native: Unhandled JS Exception: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where you attempt to access a state variable or prop before it has been assigned a value, leading to an 'undefined' error.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation using conditional rendering and/or asynchronous handling.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations, like data fetching, can lead to components rendering before their data has been retrieved. Accessing state/props before they're ready results in the 'Cannot read properties of undefined' error.

## Solution

The solution often involves one or both of these strategies:

1. **Conditional Rendering:** Only render the component's content once the necessary data is available. This prevents accessing undefined values.
2. **Asynchronous Handling:** Ensure all asynchronous operations are handled correctly, using techniques like `useEffect` and Promises/async/await, to properly manage the component's state and prevent premature access to data.

This repository is designed to illustrate this pattern, offering an educational tool for React Native developers.
